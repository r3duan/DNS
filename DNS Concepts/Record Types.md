|---|---|---|---|
| A | Address Record | Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address. | [www.example.com](https://www.example.com). IN A 192.0.2.1 |
| AAAA | IPv6 Address Record | Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address. | [www.example.com](https://www.example.com). IN AAAA 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334 |
| CNAME | Canonical Name Record | Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname. | blog.example.com. IN CNAME webserver.example.net. |
| MX | Mail Exchange Record | Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain. | example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com. |
| NS | Name Server Record | Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server. | example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com. |
| TXT | Text Record | Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies. | example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 mx -all" (SPF record) |
| SOA | Start of Authority Record | Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters. | example.com. IN SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400 |
| SRV | Service Record | Defines the hostname and port number for specific services. | _sip._udp.example.com. IN SRV 10 5 5060 sipserver.example.com. |
| PTR | Pointer Record | Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname. | 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR [www.example.com](https://www.example.com). |

The "IN" in the examples stands for "Internet." It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. In most cases, you'll see "IN" used, as it denotes the Internet protocol suite (IP) used for most domain names. Other class values exist (e.g., CH for Chaosnet, HS for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations.

In essence, "IN" is simply a convention that indicates that the record applies to the standard internet protocols we use today. While it might seem like an extra detail, understanding its meaning provides a deeper understanding of DNS record structure.
